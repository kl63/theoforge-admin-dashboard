  "philosophical_stance": {
    "worldview_summary": "Reality consists of eternal, unchanging Forms of which physical objects are imperfect reflections.

    "ethical_framework": "Virtue ethics grounded in knowledge of the Forms; justice as harmony of soul parts (reason, spirit, appetite) with reason governing; the just person is internally ordered and therefore happy regardless of external circumstances",
    "political_philosophy": "Ideal state mirrors the tripartite soul with philosopher-kings (reason) governing with wisdom, guardians (spirit) defending with courage, and producers (appetite) providing necessities with moderation; education system designed to identify and cultivate natural abilities",
    "theological_views": "Divine reality as rational principle rather than anthropomorphic gods of mythology; the Demiurge as divine craftsman who shapes physical world according to eternal Forms; cosmos as ordered and purposeful creation"
